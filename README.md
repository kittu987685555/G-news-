I developed a fully functional news application using the gnews.io API to provide real-time news articles based on user preferences. The application allows users to filter news by keyword, region, and category, making it highly customizable.

For the backend, I used Node.js with Express.js to create API routes that manage requests to the gnews.io API's, including pagination and search functionality. I implemented error handling to ensure smooth performance even when the API limit is reached or in case of incorrect input.

On the frontend, I used React.js because it allows building the app in small, reusable pieces, making the code easier to manage. I used Bootstrap to create a design that looks responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop. The layout has a search bar, filters, and a news feed with pages. Each article shows up as a card with its details.


I used axios to connect the frontend with the backend, enabling real-time data retrieval and smooth transitions between pages. The search and filter options dynamically update the content based on user input, enhancing the overall user experience.

After completing the development, I deployed the application on Firebase, making it accessible online. The entire process involved API integration, backend logic, frontend design, and deployment, resulting in a user-friendly, responsive, and scalable web application.
