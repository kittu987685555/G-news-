I developed a fully functional news application using the gnews.io API to provide real-time news articles based on user preferences. The application allows users to filter news by keyword, region, and category, making it highly customizable.

For the backend, I used Node.js with Express to create API routes that manage requests to the gnews.io API, including pagination and search functionality. I implemented error handling to ensure smooth performance even when the API limit is reached or in case of incorrect input.

On the frontend, I leveraged React for its component-based architecture, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase. Bootstrap was used to design a responsive and intuitive UI that adapts seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. The layout includes a search bar, filters, and a paginated news feed where each article is displayed in a visually appealing card format.

I used axios to connect the frontend with the backend, enabling real-time data retrieval and smooth transitions between pages. The search and filter options dynamically update the content based on user input, enhancing the overall user experience.

After completing the development, I deployed the application on Firebase, making it accessible online. The entire process involved API integration, backend logic, frontend design, and deployment, resulting in a user-friendly, responsive, and scalable web application."![Screenshot 2024-09-11 115717](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32101429-50ef-412a-8e67-cfc21f0020e3)
